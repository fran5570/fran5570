Hi, I'm Fran 

I’m passionate about technology, naturally curious, and deeply motivated to solve real-world problems through software development.

I’m currently completing my degree as a Software Development Technician, but my learning goes far beyond school. I enjoy understanding how things work, improving them, and bridging the gap between development and real human or business needs.

---

   What drives me?

- Turning ideas into practical solutions.
- Collaborating with others, sharing knowledge, and growing as a team.
- Learning something new every day.
- Understanding both the technical and human sides of a project.

---

In a few words

- I enjoy contributing to projects where I can bring more than just code.
- I always look for the “why” behind every technical decision.
- I'm interested in how programming, UX, design, and business connect.
- I adapt quickly to new challenges and tools.
